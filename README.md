## RESTful API written with ExpressJS

See [**Mongoose models**](https://github.com/CarlsJr4/carpool-manager-backend/blob/master/models/events.js) \
See [**Express routes**](https://github.com/CarlsJr4/carpool-manager-backend/tree/master/routes)

A RESTful API made to supplement my carpool manager app's frontend. Utilizes Express to listen for HTTP requests, then update corresponding data in MongoDB Atlas. 

Utilizes body-parser and cors NPM packages to receive form information from the frontend.
